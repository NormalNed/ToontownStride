DNA Tools
========

#### This is only tested with servers that use libpandadna like Toontown Stride 

DNA Tools is a modification of libpandadna to bundle all third party dependencies and not worrying about your python version.

This app is great for people to compile their DNAs in the libpandadna architecture. It requires no install and all you have to do is clone the repo to get it running.

This app comes bundled with ply and the correct python binary and a noob proof batch script.

## Usage
1: Open the Batch File

2: Type your DNA File

3: Thats its its converted
