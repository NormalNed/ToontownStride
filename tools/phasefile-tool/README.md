Phasefile Tool
========
Phasefile Tool is a noob proof version of Panda3D's multify tool that features a easy way to convert .MF files back and forth from its folder counterparts.

This app is great for people who don't want to download the full Panda3D SDK but want to view the Toontown Phase Files.

This app comes bundled with multify.exe and the correct DLLs as well as a noob proof batch script for little to no confusion.

## Usage
1: Drag .MF or Folders into the extracted directry

2: Run the .BAT

3: Type 1 or 2 depending on what your doing

4: Type Yes to verify that you are doing the correct operation

5: Watch the magic happen
